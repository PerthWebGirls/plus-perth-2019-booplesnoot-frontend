# Recipe-finder project

# Task
Your final task for this week is to set up your group project repository on GitHub that you will be using for your final project. All team members should be contributing to this repository, so make sure that each team member has been added and is comfortable pushing and pulling to their local environment. A great way of testing this is to collaboratively create a Readme.txt document that each member contributes to, outlining the vision for your project, your team members, their roles and any other key information. You may also want to consider adding some 'house rules' on your Git workflow - e.g. branch naming conventions and who is responsible for merging changes to the master branch or how to deal with merge conflicts.

# Vision
Our recipe finder app recommends recipes and food pairings with ingredients you have at home to reduce food waste, use seasonal produce and save money.

# Team members & roles
  - Project manager: Francesca
  - Git manager: Beverly
  - Front End (React): Chloe
  - Front End (HTML + CSS): Ellie
  - Backend (Database): Zoe
  - Backend (Django): Roxanne

# Git workflow house rules
  1. We have 2 repos: plus-perth-2019-booplesnoot-frontend, plus-perth-2019-booplesnoot-api
  2. We have a MASTER and a TEST branch
  3. MASTER contains deployment ready code and no one should work on MASTER
  5. Navigate to test and create your FEATURE or FIX branch i.e. dev-bev-updateReadme
  6. Work on your branch locally, stage, commit and push changes to your remote branch
  7. When your branch is working, you are ready to merge it to TEST
  8. Login to Github, navigate to TEST branch and then hit 'New pull request'
  9. Set base: test and compare: 'YourBranch', add details and assign request to a team member
  10. Assignee then goes to 'Pull requests' tab in Github and reviews your changes
  11. If there are no merge conflicts, then hit 'Merge pull request' - YOU ARE DONE
  

# Git style guide
  - Branch naming conventions: e.g. dev-zoe-apiCall | dev-ellie-webPage 
  - Commmit messages: e.g. add API call for recipes | fix user login form | update recipe review page
